ideas for distributed computing over zeromq, May 2011

Goals:
    - no central point of control or failure
    - walk-up-and join for any number of sessions
    
- udp discovery
- udp multicast file transfer using zmq channel for recovery
- heartbeating (pingpong? better than symmetric)
- irc channel group messaging, see paxos and pgm?
- point message to one peer
- security must be done using temp.symmetric keys
   - some oob exchange mechanism, perhaps ssl
- fully distributed logging, any peer can become sink
- fully distributed control, any peer can control others
   - plugin UI using OpenAMQ style admin
- simulation platform for breakage testing
- file transfer like AMQP file class (pubsub? reqrep?)

can we do this using UDP/TCP/PGM?
- transports: bluetooth, wifi
- bridging with web infrastructures, groups of groups
- mobile devices: phones, ipads
- arduino?

multicast UDP
- rate limits on wifi, need adaptive algorithm
